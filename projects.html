    <h3>(Arduino based vehicle Tracking System using GPS and GSM)</h3>
<h4>Description of the project :</h4>
<p>There are various Advanced Arduino Projects which solves the problems in our life. This is one of those Arduino projects. The advanced vehicle tracking system is an enhanced system that allows a user to track the vehicle using GPS along with the GSM modem. Using this vehicle tracking system user gets the location details of the vehicle where it is currently on his mobile and it can track it on Google map. For this purpose, we are using Arduino Uno as the main processing unit. The whole system is controlled by Arduino Uno. This Arduino is interfaced with LCD to display longitude and latitude. Also, it is interfaced with GPS and GSM modem. GSM modem is used to send SMS to the owner of the system.

    Description of the project
    There are various Advanced Arduino Projects which solves the problems in our life. This is one of those Arduino projects. The advanced vehicle tracking system is an enhanced system that allows a user to track the vehicle using GPS along with the GSM modem. Using this vehicle tracking system user gets the location details of the vehicle where it is currently on his mobile and it can track it on Google map. For this purpose, we are using Arduino Uno as the main processing unit. The whole system is controlled by Arduino Uno. This Arduino is interfaced with LCD to display longitude and latitude. Also, it is interfaced with GPS and GSM modem. GSM modem is used to send SMS to the owner of the system.
    
    Working of the project
    Once you start the system it starts sending location details. The user receives an SMS containing URL of location details. Once the user clicks on the URL, he/she can see the location on Google Maps with a marker. Nowadays every smartphone has Google Maps application preinstalled. So this URL opens in the Google Maps app. GPS tracker system constantly keeps on sending SMS of location details of where the vehicle is located. Using the map we can see the places around the vehicle also we can see the road on the map. So in this way the user can get the location of the vehicle and real-time vehicle location details. The system also has an SOS button which is used to send an SMS to the owner if there is an emergency.
    
    Real time vehicle tracking system using Arduino, GSM, and GPS is an innovative and user-friendly system. Sometimes a companyâ€™s transportation vehicles consume more and more fuel which results in loss of money. The solution for this is to install a GPS tracking device in the vehicle. It sends real-time updates of the vehicle coordinates. It also improves the safety and security of our car. We can also see the history by scrolling down through the SMS history in our SMS inbox. By using the tracker system can see what time the car was at which place.</p>

<p><strong>You will get a CD with this project containing following documents:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Project Report in pdf format and in word format ( .doc or .docx )</li>
<li>Circuit diagram</li>
<li>PCB layout</li>
<li>Arduino Uno Program in embedded c language</li>
<li>Datasheets of all the components / ICs used in the project</li>
<li>Power point presentation / PPT file</li>

<h4>Description in detail:</h4>
<p>GPS stands for Global Positioning System. Three satellites give exact position which means GPS modem should receive the signal from 3 satellites. GPS receives data from Antenna. GPS antenna should be sky facing. GSM module is used to communicate for calls and SMS. We need to insert sim card into the GSM modem.</p>
<p>Smart GPS tracking device should be fitted inside the car where it is not visible. This project can be operated on battery of the vehicle
</p>
<h4>Applications of GPS Vehicle Tracker:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Vehicle tracker can be used in a motorcycle, car, school bus, truck, transport vehicles.</li>
    <li>We can also use this system for vehicle accident detection. And we can use it for woman tracking, child tracking system.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Advantages of GSM and GPS vehicle tracking system:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>We donâ€™t have to call the driver to know their location. We can track the route</li>
    <li>Fleet management system is the fastest, easiest, and reliable. So user can stay stress-free by installing this system to track his/her vehicle</li>
</ol>
<h4>Future Development:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>We can send multiple SMS to multiple mobile numbers. Also, we can dial a call to mobile numbers</li>
    <li>Over-speed detection and hard breaking detection can be done in a future enhancement.</li>
    <li>We can send data to a server using IOT (Internet of Things) and then we can see the location by accessing the website through the internet.</li>
